<p  style="color:red"> Once the prologue begins, Elma will give you a little tutorial on how to use the mini-map.

Close the tutorial and move South towards the checkpoint marked by the yellow pulsating circle on the mini-map. After the cutscene, familliarize yourself with the drawing controls.

Defeating the Origin Blatta is as easy as drawing your weapon and ensuing that you aim directly towards it until all of its health is depleted.

Pick up the Advanced Iron Knife and continue Eastward along the path.

Field Access Point: While exploring the area, walk up to the objects marked with yellow boxes on the mini-map and complete field actions to collect Prototype Bodywear, Prototype Boots, and other items.
As you continue onwards, you will encounter several enemies. Choose whether to attack them or not, and then proceed across the small body of water and up the grass path on the other side. Continue towards the next checkpoint, defeating enemies along the way.

Now it's time to enjoy Primordia's open environments during the daylight.

Familiarize yourself with Sprint Mode and get going to your next destination. You can either stick to the path you are already on, or you can jump off the cliffside and continue along the beaches underneath.

West Gate Plain

Once you arrive at the west entrance of the ship, you will be tasked with defeating 3 Grexes during the same battle sequence.

The three Grexes are not all that difficult to take down. Just focus your main attack on one enemy at a time and circle around to avoid being hit by incoming attacks. At certain times, the Grexes will become immobile. When they do, move in and attack with a close-range Art. 
Elma remarks about the fine line between provoking a fight and fighting as a means for survival--an important piece of information to keep in mind while coming in conctact with enemies on Mira. Some of the native creatures are docile while others will attack on site, so be wary of the behaviour of each species.

Just to the left of the west gate you will meet Piers. He tells you that the west gate entracne is closed for the moment. Head up the stairs on your left. When you reach the top, take the elevator and climb up the next flight of stairs.

Walk down the hall of the ship and a cutscene will play, introducing you to your new home and marking the end of the prologue.</p>
