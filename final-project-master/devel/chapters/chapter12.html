The mission will start off with a cutscene in which Chausson says that we have located the Lifehold Core and that now we will be to get to it and activate the backup power system. After a few more cutscenes, we’ll need to head over to BLADE Tower to talk to Commander Vandham so that we can get the coordinates for where the Lifehold Core is. We’ll have to get to the area by going to Cauldros and then flying in the direction of the coordinates, which is in the ocean to the left of the region.

Once you’re close enough to the Lifehold Core, you’ll get another cutscene in which we find the Ganglion attempting to attack the Lifehold Core and not being able to get through it due to a force field around it. After that, ignore all the Ganglion Skells and head towards the Lifehold. Another cutscene will then happen once more in which we arrive at the entrance and find out that the Core only has 15 minutes before everything shuts down. Once you’re out of the cutscene, this will be your last chance to save before being unable to for the rest of the Chapter.

 Once you’re ready, check the object in front of the entrance to enter the Lifehold Core. We will then get a cutscene in which Luxaar decides to use the Vita, the alien Skell that the Ganglion were after earlier in the story. After that, we’ll be back in the game. Go forward and another cutscene will happen in which we find out that the official story of us controlling our mimeosomes from stasis is not necessarily true. Luxaar will then break through and we’ll have to fight him in the Vita.

The Vita is a Lv. 50 Skell and isn’t quite difficult to defeat, although he does have an attack in which he shrouds himself in a circular shield and reflects a portion of damage in that form. Other than that, simply attack his appendages until his health is at half and a cutscene will play out in which we learn that we are probably the descendants of the Samaarians.

Luxaar will then transform the Vita into a somewhat more powerful version. The lost health it had will be restored, and it will spawn various Satellis enemies that each assist the Vita with various functions. However, while he regains all of his health, so do you, so it will be like an entirely new fight. Rather than attacking the Satellis and then focusing on the Vita, just attack the Vita and kill it as quickly as possible. If you take too long to defeat the Vita, he will gain a shield once he reaches around a quarter of his health that will make him invulnerable to all damage.

To destroy the shield, you’ll need to defeat the Shield Satellis in the middle of the area, although it is invulnerable before then. When it is destroyed, the Vita will spawn many more Satellis enemies. Another thing to note is that even if the Satellis enemies are destroyed beforehand, they will eventually be respawned by the Vita anyways.

With that, the Vita fight will be over and a cutscene will play out in which we learn more about the truth regarding the Lifehold Core, our bodies, and the whole situation regarding the White Whale as well as the human race. After that, we’ll find that Luxaar is still alive and trying to destroy the Core mainframe. The mainframe will create Chimera enemies to defend itself and Lao will appear to kill Luxaar by stabbing him through the back with his javelin. We’ll then have to fight ten Lv. 48 Soldier Chimeras.

It’s somewhat difficult considering the number of enemies, but just deal with them one at a time and you’ll eventually kill them all. Lao and Luxaar will then fall into the protoplasmic fluid, and Lao will be transformed into a Lv. 50 monster by the Core mainframe that we will have to defeat.

Lao is a difficult fight, because he is all around difficult in the first half of the fight, and the second half, which activates and acts like a similar version of the Vita fight. In the second half, he has the ability to spawn various Chimeras, namely a Lv. 50 Queen Chimera and a Lv. 48 Minor Chimera at different parts of the fight. If he’s too difficult for you, even at a higher level, it’s perfectly okay to battle him with a reduced level.

Once Lao is defeated, several cutscenes will occur regarding the Ganglion, Elma, and the situation at hand. Once they’re over, the last story mission will be complete for Xenoblade Chronicles X!
