<p style="color:red"> The mission will start off with us having to go to the Restricted Hangar due to a problem reported by Vandham. When we’re there, we’ll find out that Lao is leaving with important data along with a new Skell, and that he will reveal to everyone he was in fact that Ganglion spy. We’ll go after him by following him to the Ganglion base located in Cauldros.

The closest spot to fast travel from is FN Site 506 or the Ruined City of O’rrh Sim. If you don’t have a Skell, you’ll have to walk from FN Site 511 to the objective. Once you’re near there, you’ll trigger a cutscene in which afterwards we’ll have to search for Lao inside of the castle. In front of the gate to the entrance, you’ll find a Lv. 43 Marnuck Imperial as well as a Lv. 41 Marnuck Imperial that you can deal with using your Skell if you have one.  

Once they’re dead, you’ll have to go inside without your Skell. We’ll have to go left, but watch out, as you will have to fight three Lv. 41 Marnuck Imperials that run in your direction. You can use your Skell for this fight if you have one, and it’s recommended to make the fight finish up faster. Once you’re done, follow the path and another three Marnuck Imperials will show up. After you kill them, head back up the path and take a right, then go down the elevator for a Lv. 2 Archaelogical field action that is guarded by a Lv. 43 Marnuck Imperial. Then, head back up, and go straight and prepare for a fight. You’ll need to fight a tyrant Lv. 40 Frontline Medic Quo and two Lv. 41 Marnuck Imperials. It’s not a very difficult one however, and you should be able to easily deal with the enemies.

Then, head left for a Lv. 3 Archaelogical field action, and then straight to continue onwards. In front of the gate is a Lv. 42 Marnuck Imperial and in the next room in front of him is another one. Head down the elevator after him and you’ll find a Lv. 43 Swift Shrad that you’ll have to defeat. Then, after the long corridor to the right of it, you’ll have to fight a Lv. 37 tyrant called Enhanced Attack Range Zig, along with one or two Lv. 40 Milsaadi Hunters. Once it’s dead, head to the left of the area and go up the stairs, making sure not to coincide with the patrolling Milsaadi hunter.

Once you’ve done that, head through the pathway and you’ll initiate a cutscene in which we’ll have to fight a Lv. 44 Force Seidr. It’s not very difficult, just aim for the appendages and you shouldn’t have any issues. We’ll then get a cutscene about how we can now use our Skells inside of the castle.

Head back inside and go into the door that goes to the next objective and head down the elevator. We’ll initiate a cutscene afterwards in which we’ll meet up once more with Lao before fighting him in the new Skell, the Lv. 45 Prog Ares. It’s not a complex fight at first, just aim for his appendages and then at around half health, a new cutscene will occur in which we find out that the passengers from the White Whale were mostly elite and that they were purposefully chosen to leave the planet. Then, the fight will resume, with him at full health.

The strategy is the same as before, continue to hit his appendages and he’ll eventually be destroyed. A cutscene will play out in which Lao realizes he was in the wrong all along and that we need to go back to NLA to talk to Commander Vandham to discuss Lao. After that, the mission will be over!

                In order to start the final story mission for Chapter 12, you’ll need to have a Skell as well as a flight pack for it and have Elma, Lin, and another party member that is not Nagi. Once you’ve got all of that, head to the BLADE Barracks to accept the mission at the story table to start the final Chapter!
