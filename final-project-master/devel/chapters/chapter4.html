<p style="color: red"> At this point, the game will begin opening up. Elma explains that your main duties include installing data probes to make travel easier across Mira, securing missing pieces of the Lifehold in order to find frozen humans to ensure human establishment on the planet, and defeating enemies like Prones who seek to annihilate the human species. With these responsibilities you are now free to select from main story missions, missions to aid your division, or side missions.

Along with the freedom to choose the type of mission to take on, BLADE reports and Blade Scout are also available. BLADE Reports will allow you to share info and cooperate with other Xenoblade players. The BLADE Scout Console is finally available to use. You can use the console to enlist the aid of BLADE operatives from another team for a limited time.

Elenora will teach you how to edit your greetings so that you leave a good, or bad, first impression on the other players that you meet.

Vandham talks about your choice to change classes once you hit rank 10. Changing from Drifter to a higher class lets you use skills. Vandham reminds you that you can change classes whenever you want.

Elena will tell you about your freedom to select party members. They will be waiting in the barracks at all times.

Follow the onscreen instructions to select preferred social settings.

Finally, a screen dedicated to character information is displayed to let you know which party members you can enlist.

Now would be a good time to select a new class. As long as you are a level 10 Drifter, you can choose from more advanced classes and change them anytime you want. Choosing a class will provide your character with new skills (passive abilities that can be upgraded just like arts), weapons, and arts. 
To begin Chapter 4, you will have to complete these two missions: BLADE Level Basics and The Probe-fessional. Along with the two missions, you will also have to hit a survey rate of at least 15% in Primordia. Complete the two missions and the final prerequisite before revisiting this section of the guide. A walkthrough for each required mission has been provided along with strategies to increase your survey rate of Primordia.

While in the BLADE barracks, head to the conference room opposite the entrance. When selecting to begin the mission, make sure that you have completed all of the prerequisites first and that you have the required party members with you and any others you may have found while completing other missions.

Enemies encountered in this mission will primarily range from Level 11 to 16. Being at Level 15 to begin this mission will make easy work of the tasks ahead.
You will share a meal with Vandham, after which he briefs you on the mission ahead. The task seems straightforward enough: a piece of the Lifehold has been detected in Noctilum and it’s your job to recover it.

Your first objective will be to meet with Lao near Primordia’s Green Threshold. If you have explored enough of Primordia, you should already have a data probe installed there, so just teleport to the area. If not, use the handy Follow Ball until you reach your destination.

After a little discussion with Lao, he will nearly beg to join your team. He hasn’t much to say about seeing a Lifehold piece in the area, but he does provide some further advice on the importance of using FrontierNav to harvest miranium. To complement his advice, Lin will provide you with a gift of miranium. Remember the visit taken earlier to the Arms Manufacturers back in Chapter 3? Miranium will be used to lend support to AMs and create augments for you gear.

Walk up to Lao and accept him as a party member—the extra help won’t hurt.

If you want Lao to join your party and you already have four members, you will have to remove one. Elma and Lin are mandatory members for the mission.
Use the Follow Ball to track your journey to Noctilum’s Sunlit Spring, or fast travel there if available. As you fight your way to the marker on the map, you will encounter L’cirufe. L will tell you that he has found an interesting discovery—probably a piece of the Lifehold—and joins you as a travelling companion. Before continuing your trek, now is a perfect time to make sure your party is as formidable as it can be; a battle awaits. Be sure to equip your strongest gear, upgrade your arts, and assign your choice of skills to each party member. Once you’re ready for battle, continue forward.

Three Prone Destroyers are bombarding the piece of the Lifehold—time to defeat them. Focus on one at a time and be sure to respond to your party’s soul voices to make short work of the enemies.

The second portion of the battle will have you face three Ganglion, including one of their higher members, Goetia. Deal with the two Marnucks first, then focus your attention on their leader. Try using arts to topple her, and then use melee arts to take her down. With that settled for now, take your party and L back to NLA to meet Vanham in BLADE Tower.

In a discussion with Nagi and Maurice you learn that what the Ganglion attacked was actually an Archive unit and not the Core. Chapter 4 is complete.</p>
