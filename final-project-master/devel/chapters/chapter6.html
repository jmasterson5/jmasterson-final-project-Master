<p style="color:red"> prerequisites: To start the story mission for Chapter 6, you need to have only Elma and Lin in your team, survey 20% of Noctilum, and complete “A Friend in Need”.

So first thing’s first, take off any fourth member on your team if you have any so that you only have Elma and Lin. Then, we’ll go ahead and compete “A Friend in Need”. In the BLADE Barracks, go to the story table and accept the quest behind it. You’ll be briefed on how Lao’s team ran out of supplies and now we have to help them out. Once you’ve accepted the quest, go and get another party member before fast traveling to FN Site 306 or the closest segment to the location we need to go to in Oblivia. It is extremely important that you have four party members, because the boss of this quest is extremely difficult with only three. If you traveled to FN Site 306, you’ll have to backtrack a bit because we need to go around the huge cliff to the left of the probe location. After that, just head towards the direction and you should make it to Lao’s team in no time. If you decide to walk along the Cliffside, be careful, as near a field action there is a Lv. 28 tyrant indigen that will attack you when you get close. It is hidden in the ground as a rock, so walk around the large rock in front of the field action and continue on your way. Once you’re near Lao’s team, talk to Saiden. We’ll meet up with Lao’s team and escort them to a data probe location.

Once the cutscene is over, swim through the lake in the direction of the yellow arrow and when you’re close to the yellow circle on the minimap, you’ll initiate another small cutscene. Once it’s over, head into the pathway up ahead and kill six Lv. 15/16/17 Chasm Forfexes to continue the mission.  Once you kill them, continue forward along the path in the direction of the yellow arrow on the minimap and you’ll trigger a cutscene in which a large indigen invades the area and we have to defeat it. The enemy is a Lv. 19 Fierce Vigent. This is a very difficult enemy to kill, because it has a very high amount of health as well as having powerful attacks which can easily kill you. It has a jumping attack that can do disgustingly high amounts of damage and can also reduce the damage that is dealt to it by shielding his face with his hand. The best tactic for this fight is to lock onto one of his arms or legs and then tell your team to concentrate fire in the Battle Menu. It’s likely this fight will take you several tries before you defeat it, as it really is difficult to kill. If you die enough times, in the respawn menu the game will ask you if you wish to make the boss easier. It is recommended you accept the proposal, as the boss is generally too difficult to beat regularly. He’ll become Lv. 14 and as a result should be much easier to deal with. Once it’s dead, all you have to do to finish the mission is to head back to NLA and talk to Saiden’s group by following the yellow arrow while in the administrative district. Once you finish the cutscene, you’ll finish the mission. All you have to do now is explore 20% of Noctilum and then start the story mission with only Lin and Elma on your team. 

CHAPTER 6 WALKTHROUGH

The story mission will begin with a cutscene that shows a battle between the Ganglion and an alien race, the Tainted. We’ll then see Goetia talking with a new character, Grandmaster Luxaar, who is the leader of the Ganglions. After that, we’ll get another cutscene in which Lao comes to discuss an alien mech that nobody has seen before and that the Ganglion are after it as well, although they haven’t been able to get it because the Tainted protect the area as they are territorial.

Our job will be to go out to Noctilum and pick it up. Once the cutscene is over, head out to the closest area in Noctilum to the objective and start heading over there, the best place being FN Site 210 because it leads right to the entrance to where we need to go. You can get there by heading up through the Ganglion camp to the left, and then heading upwards and towards the cliff that was to the right of the Probe location. Once you’re close to it, you’ll get a cutscene. As you go through the area, there will be enemies lurking in the ground that are Lv. 22 and 23 called Terrible Germivores. Just be careful to not hit any of the Lv. 31 flying enemies, or otherwise you’ll have to run away.

At the end of the Cliffside path, there is a giant Lv. 40 tyrant indigen that is pretending to be a tree called Pizelle, the Purple Lightning. Just hug the wall to the right going into the cave and you shouldn’t wake him up. In the cave, there is a Lv. 24 False Thallus that you can kill. Another one will be up ahead, although it is hiding by hanging off of the roof of the cliff.

Once you’re in Dead Man’s Gulch, a cutscene will play out in which confirm that the Tainted will not attack mimeosomes. After the cutscene, turn around and install the data probe there, and pick up the Lv. 1 Archaeological field action. Continuing on the path, the Tainted enemies are not very difficult to kill if you wish to gain some extra experience, but try not to attack them more than one at a time, as it can get a bit crazy then. Otherwise, you can just move around the Tainted. Regardless, be sure to pick up the Lv. 1 Archaeological field actions along the way. Eventually you’ll come across some Lv. 23 and 24 Tainted Scintimures in the air, try and ignore them as they’re difficult to kill. Head into the middle area to initiate a cutscene in which we check out the alien mech.

After they pick it up to send back to headquarters, we find that Tatsu was on board and because of this we’ll have to fight three Lv. 20 Tainted Caros. After we defeat them, we’ll have to defeat a Lv. 24 Tainted Sphinx. The Sphinx itself isn’t difficult as long as you keep attacking the main weak points, mainly the face and then the legs, as his arms are too difficult to kill normally. It can also call in a Lv. 19 or 20 Tainted Caro, so be careful if it does that, but never try to kill it because it will disappear after you kill the Sphinx. Once it’s dead, you’ll see a cutscene in which a large indigen saves us from several more Tainted Sphinx.

After that’s over, head back to NLA and report to Vandham to finish up the quest! You can find Vandham by heading to the BLADE Barracks, going left to the exit of the east gate, and heading down the elevator that will be on the left side of the road. Once you’re close to him, there will be a cutscene in which Lin will be assigned to research the new mech before anyone else. Afterwards, we’ll get a cutscene Grandmaster Luxaar discusses various things with a former prince of the Wroth, Ga Jiarg, who are a new alien race. After that, the story mission will be complete, and we’ll get a notification saying that we can get a skell license by seeing Vandham.

In order to continue onto Chapter 7, we need to survey 25% of Oblivia, complete the “Close Comrades” mission, and have Elma/Lin in our party and Irina/Gwin out of it. So for the “Close Comrades” quest, we’ll need to head to BLADE Concourse and talk to Doug, but first, take Lao off your team for now. We can only have Elma and Lin on our party for this quest, so take Lao off and head up to the BLADE Barracks.

From there, go to Armory Alley and to the right of the entrance you should see the orange icon for a quest which will be Close Comrades. Accept it and a cutscene will play out in which Lao couldn’t help Doug out with a quest they were assigned, so we’ll help Doug out with the mission. After the cutscene, head as close to the three places we need to go to in Noctilum as you can. FN Site 218 and FN Site 216 are both good choices, although 216 is a bit safer. All you need to do is go to all three locations and interact with the plants. After you pick up the third, you’ll get a cutscene in which Doug will ask us to collect the fourth piece of data from another plant.

When you get close to it, another cutscene will occur in which we’ll have to kill five Lv. 14/15/16 Arrow Germivores. After that, we’ll have to defeat a large Lv. 18 Arrow Cincula and five Lv. 14/15/16 Arrow Germivores with the help of Doug. Try and focus on the Germivores before killing the Lv. 18 Arrow Cincula, as they could get annoying otherwise. Once you’ve done that, fast travel to Barista Court in the Commercial District of NLA and go talk to Lao. A cutscene will happen in which the group will have some light banter and the mission will be completed.

Once you’ve done that, be sure to put someone onto your team who isn’t Irina or Gwin, survey 25% of Oblivia (as a side note, you most likely won’t be able to get the full 25% through just placing data probes, so be sure to kill some of the lower leveled tyrants when you can), and accept the quest at the story table in the BLADE Barracks to start Chapter 7!
