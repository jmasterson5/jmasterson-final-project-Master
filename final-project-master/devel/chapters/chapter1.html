<p style="color:red">After the little to Irina Akulov and Gwin Evans. It’ll be time to head to the administrative district to see where you will be staying.
After the short cutscene, you will be lead to the Active Members Screen, a window that lets you select and confirm party members. Since you are only part of a band of three, you can just confirm your current party and get going. If you really want to, you can change the order of Elma and Lin, though this probably won’t do you much good this early on in the game.

Without a functioning Skell, you will have to travel to the administrative district via a transport pilot.  Walk away from Doug and towards the green exclamation point on the mini-map to meet the pilot. No introduction here; the pilot will take the trio to their destination and Lin will give you a quick tour of NLA’s districts.
After landing and listening to the 13-year-old’s little information session, travel eastward and around the BLADE Tower to the BLADE Barracks. Here you will meet the former captain of the White Whale, Kentaro Nagi. This portion of Chapter 1 will end with a discussion about the happening’s before the White Whale crashed on Mira: how the survivors of the crash converted the ship to a habitable city, the creation of the Builders of the Legacy After the Destruction of Earth (BLADE), and the all-important mission to locate the Lifehold.

To exit the barracks, head toward the west door. Upon approaching the door, press A and select “Yes” to leave the building. Once back in the administration district, both Lin and Elma will tell you that you are not certified to use a Skell—another tease for the vehicle you won’t be able to use for a long while.

Once the drooling session is over, walk over to Mission Control and then to its immediate right to learn about the BLADE Scout Console.

Mission Control allows BLADE members assigned to a specific division to sign up for missions. The BLADE Scout Console is used to find allies to help you with particularly difficult missions. 
The penultimate stop on your tour of the administration district is Armory Alley; it’s just to the right of the BLADE Scout Console.
