The usual cutscene will tell us that the mission is about a mysterious piece of the Lifehold that could be the Core, however, it’s up in Sylvalum which has had sightings of Ganglion enemies. The first thing we’ll need to do is meet up with Lao’s team, so head back to the probe we installed before starting the chapter: FN Site 403.

Once there, head up towards the opening up ahead to meet up with Lao and find out that he is injured. After the series of cutscenes, we’ll find that his entire team was killed by the Ganglion and that the Lifehold unit is up north. Up ahead, you’ll see two Lv. 30 enemies ahead, but if you wait, they’ll start patrolling the nearby area and move out of the way. However, if you’re in a Skell, they are relatively easy to defeat although they can fly up into the air and be annoying to hit that way. Then, head directly left and follow along the wall up north if you don’t want to interact with any enemies. Then, be sure to install the data probe at FN Site 405.

Once you’ve done that, look north to see the large lake, and then continue towards the yellow arrow on your minimap to reach the next objective. Be sure to go around the high leveled 40 and 50 enemies directly along the coast, though, as well as the Sacrifole enemies that are above ground and hidden in the water. Once you’re on the other side of the lake in the direction of the next objective remember to install the data probe there, although be careful of the Lv. 51 tyrant who is running around with multiple Lv. 48/49 enemies. After that, look out for any hidden enemies that look like large rocks, as they appear in this area with many crystals.

Once you’re at the objective, a cutscene will play out in which we’re led to a trap and the Wroth capture us. We’ll learn that the Ganglion fear our real bodies, for reasons unknown. After the cutscene, we’ll have to defeat Lv. 34 Ga Jiarg, Lv. 33 Ga Buidhe, three Lv. 32 Wrothian Enacters and one Lv. 32 Wrothian Sneaker. However, for this fight, you will not be allowed to use your Skell, making it a difficult fight.

The best tactic for this fight is to defeat all the lower leveled enemies first, and then move onto Jiarg and Buidhe. If you can’t defeat the enemies normally, you can always lower the difficulty after dying enough times to lower them down to an easier to deal with level. Once they’re all dead, you’ll fight the second part of the battle: A Lv. 35 Vasara and a Lv. 34 Deva Caladar, and you are able to use a Skell for this part of the fight. First, defeat the Lv. 34 Deva Caladar using your Skells, and then focus on Vasara. Once Vasara reaches around 50% HP, they’ll call in four Lv. 34 Caladars that you’ll have to kill before being able to attack the Vasara again. There’s no real way to easily defeat all of them, so just kill them off one by one until only Vasara is left, and then finish him off from there. After he dies, a cutscene will play out in which we discover the location of the Ganglion hideout and Jiarg announces his independence from the Ganglion.

After that, you’ll have to head back to the maintenance center in NLA and enter the building. We’ll see a cutscene in which Lao’s mimeosome was saved and how Elma suspects him of being a spy for the Ganglion. After that, the story mission will be complete for Chapter 9! You’ll get a notification regarding the Skell Flight Module which you should definitely pick up if you have a Skell, you can do so by accepting the Flight Module quest at the mission board.  

For the next story mission, we’ll need the mission “Manhunt” complete, have Elma and Lin in our party (and preferably another member), and have 15% of Sylvalum surveyed. Let’s first get started with the “Manhunt” quest, which can be found in front of BLADE Tower to the left of the entrance. Start the quest and you’ll view a cutscene in which we accept a mission to track Ryyz and Dagahn in Noctilum.

Once you’ve accepted the quest, head to Noctilum by fast traveling to one of the closer areas near the objective. After you get there, you’ll find that there was a fire that was recently extinguished in the area. Our team will hear something and will go hide, and we’ll find that Ganglion soldiers are looking for a pair of people with one the size of a mech. We’ll decide to interrogate them, and you’ll have to fight the two Lv. 30/31 Marnuck Soldiers. Once you’ve killed them, we’ll find out where the pair have been sighted by the Ganglion. At this point, fast travel to FN Site 210 and head towards the objective, which can be found inside of a cave. You’ll find more Ganglion Soldiers trying to capture the pair, who turn out to not be Ryyz and Dagahn. You’ll have to fight a Lv. 34 Marnuck Commander as well as five Lv. 30 Marnuck Soldiers.

Try and focus down the Marnuck Commander first before killing the Soldiers, as they all have quite a bit of HP. After they’ve died, you’ll meet Rock and Celica, who we will invite to stay in NLA for the time being. Once the cutscene is over, fast travel to the Industrial District in NLA and go check on them. A cutscene will occur in which the two of them are enjoying their stay and would like to be here permanently, and afterwards, the mission will be completed! Now what you’ll have to do is survey 15% of Sylvalum, and once you’ve done that, head to the story board in the BLADE Barracks with at least Elma and Lin in your party, as well as another member to make the game less challenging, and now you can begin Chapter 10!
