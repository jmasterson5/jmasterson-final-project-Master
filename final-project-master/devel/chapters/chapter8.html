<p style="color:red">Once you start the quest, the usual cutscene will play out however an alarm will go off in the middle of it. The alarm signals that the Ganglion are marching on to attack NLA and we’ll watch Secretary Nagi give a speech to the BLADE. Once you’re out of the cutscenes, one of the main things that changes is that the terminals that were located in Armory Alley can be found near the BLADE Barracks exit.

After you’re ready, head on out through the exit to NLA and you’ll view a few more small cutscenes. Once they’re over, you’ll have to fight three Lv. 28 Scout Puges and two Lv. 28 Strike Pugiliths. If you have Skells, you can find them behind you. The best way to deal with this fight is to kill off the Puges first, and then defeat the Pugiliths.

Once they’re dead, you’ll have to fight the second wave of enemies. It consists of one Lv. 28 Assister Quo and two Lv. 29 Assault Qmoeva then as you’re almost finished, another Assister Quo and Assault Qmoeva will join the fight. Once they’re dead, you’ll have to fight two Lv. 27 Impact Galdrs. There will be a cutscene afterwards in which the Ganglion will be attacking from above NLA, so we’ll be moving the fight into the city. A few more cutscenes will happen afterwards and we’ll meet Ryyz and Dagahn, who we will be fighting next.  After the cutscenes are over, head towards the Commercial District.

If you don’t have a Skell, you can take the path up ahead towards the Commercial District, but if you do have one you can just jump over the broken bridge sections on the left side of the area, although there are quite a few enemies in the area, you should be able to deal with them easily using a Skell. On the northern path, you’ll find two Lv. 30 Talon Knight Qmoevas in the area, and then a Lv. 28 Assault Pugilith past them. Then, you’ll find two Lv. 26 Strike Puges. To the left of them you’ll find many enemies consisting of more Talon Knight Qmoevas, Strike Puges, and Lv. 25 Marnuck Soldiers, but it’s probably best you ignore them.

Straight down East Melville Street, you’ll find another Talon Knight Qmoeva you’ll have to defeat. Then, you’ll find a Lv. 28 Strike Pugilist as well as three Lv. 25 Marnuck Soldiers, but you can just run past them if you want. After that, you’ll find another Strike Puge, you’ll want to kill that one if possible but if you manage to run past it that’s the best outcome. Then, you can run past all the other enemies to get to the next objective.

                A cutscene will play out in which the team will be introduced to Ryyz and Dagahn. Once the cutscene is over, you’ll want to focus on Lv. 31 Ryyz first before fighting the Lv. 31 Dagahn, and then once she’s at low enough health, you’ll only be able to attack Dagahn.  If you have a Skell, the fight should be relatively easy if you do the fight that way. Once the fight is over, we’ll find that the alien skell was taken by Ga Jiarg and his accomplices. After that, there will be several more cutscenes will happen. One in particular hints that Lao is working for the Ganglions, and that Luxaar now has the alien Skell which is called “the Great One’s vessel”. After that the mission will be finished for Chapter 8.

                In order to start Chapter 9’s story mission, you must have the “Spy Games” quest completed, have at least one data probe installed in Sylvalum, have Elma and Lin in your party, and not have Doug and Lao in your party. So, first things first, get a party member into your team that isn’t Lao, Doug, or Nagi. Lao because he isn’t usable during the next story mission and we won’t be able to use him until Chapter 12 afterwards, Doug because he isn’t usable during the next story mission, and Nagi because he’s not usable during “Spy Games”.

Once you have a full party member, let’s get the data probe in Sylvalum installed. The best way to get the Sylvalum probe installed is to head to Primordia’s FN Site 113 and then heading along the string of small islands in front of the data probe. Near the mainland of Sylvalum, you’ll find some Remote Pugilith enemies of varying levels in the 30s, as well as some Prone enemies of the same varying levels. If you want to, though, you can just swim around them entirely to Sylvalum. Once you discover Sylvalum, head forward and you should be able to find the probe location quite easily. Then, fast travel to the BLADE Tower so that we can start the “Spy Games” quest, it will be the quest icon to the right of the door leading into the Tower.

                Once you accept the quest, you’ll get a cutscene in which we discuss a surprise attack on Jair Fortress and how Chausson wants us to infiltrate the area before the attack happens so that we can get more intel on the Ganglion’s current state. Once the cutscene is over, head back to the BLADE Barracks to initiate another cutscene in which we discuss various things with Secretary Nagi.

After that, travel to the area closest to Jair Fortress, or to Jair Fortress itself if you’ve unlocked the fast travel option for it. For the next part, it’s better not to be in a Skell, as there are many high leveled enemies that can do a lot of damage to them when instead you can sneak by most of them. From the fast travel area, you can head around all the enemies by jumping down the cliff to the left of where most of the ground troops are and going straight until you can head up towards the objective. You might run into a few enemies, but just sprint past them into the big building and you’ll trigger a cutscene in which we decide to take the information on a drive rather than getting the information there. Then, you’ll have to fight three Lv. 30 Marnucks. They shouldn’t be too difficult, just aim for their weak spots one at a time and defeat them. Another cutscene will play out, and our next objective will be to head back to Chausson who is located in the BLADE Tower.

Once you interact with the BLADE Tower door, you’ll get another cutscene. Afterwards, we’ll meet up with Pleffen on the starboard side of the Ma-non ship to have him analyze the data on the drive we brought with us. After that, head back to the BLADE Tower and talk with Chausson once more and the quest will be complete! At this point, you can now start the next Chapter.</p>
