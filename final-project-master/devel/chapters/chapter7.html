<p style="color:red">The cutscene will start off by explaining that Irina’s team needs backup getting to a piece of the Lifehold and that we’ll be helping them out. Once the cutscene is over, fast travel to the closest area to the objective, the best one being FN Site 321 or the Central Ibra Ravine. After you arrive, a cutscene will play out in which we’ll agree to keep the hostiles busy. Head forward and kill the two Lv. 22 Assault Qmoevas. Then, you’ll have to kill one Lv. 24 Pursuit and two Lv. 24 Assault Qmoevas. Once they’re dead, head towards the next objective, fast traveling if possible. Once you’re near the Gwin, a cutscene will play out in which we’ll found out that the calmness surrounding the Lifehold piece was a trap. We’ll have to fight the Lv. 28 Almandal, who is being piloted by Goetia. It’s a very difficult enemy, and if you have a Skell, it’s recommended you use it. When prioritizing the weak points, save the tail for last, as it has a lot of health and you won’t be able to break it easily. However, if you are able to kill of the tail, do so, as the Almandal has a very strong area of effect attack in which it spins and deals a high amount of damage to everyone. If you die and the game asks you if you want to lower the difficulty, it’s recommended you do so as the boss does quite a large amount of damage and has a very high health pool. When the difficulty is lowered, the Almandal is Lv. 23 and is much easier to defeat, although it still packs quite a punch. Once it’s dead, you’ll get a cutscene which explains a little bit about Irina and her backstory. Once it’s over, head back to the front of BLACK Tower and talk to Vandham to end the mission.

                To start Chapter 8, you must have “The Matchmaker” completed, be Lv. 30, have 10% of Mira explored, and start the quest with a team with Elma and Lin only. First off, let’s start “The Matchmaker”, which can be found in the Barista Court of the Commercial District, in the same place we found Lao in this area during the “Close Comrades” mission. You’ll also have to take off Lao, or anyone else, from your team, as you must only have Elma and Lin to start the quest. Once you’ve started it, a cutscene will play out in which we talk with Lao’s team a bit and how one of his members, Shingo, has a crush on someone. We’ll agree to help, and to start off the quest, we need to head to North Founders Street. A cutscene will occur in which we meet the girl Shingo likes, Dorothy, and how Shingo decides to get an accessory for her when he asks her out to a date. Once the cutscene is over, we’ll have to head to Omari on West Melville Street. Once you’re there, Omari will tell us that his tools aren’t able to carve a stone from the large rock that we have for Shingo. Lao will then come and join our party, and we’ll have to head to the Ma-non ship to meet up with Jeshero, a craftsman. You can get to the Ma-non ship by one of the machines that can teleport you there, one of the easily accessible ones can be found near BLADE Tower, in the direction of Armory Alley. Once you’re on the ship, head to the Starboard to meet up with Jeshero. Jeshero will want 10 pizzas for his work, so head back to the Commercial District and head to West Melville Street and order some Army Pizzas. Order the pizzas for 10,000 credits, and once you’re done, head back up to the Ma-Non ship and talk to Jeshero again. He’ll give Shingo the bracelet and the last step for the mission is that we’ll have to go check on him by heading back to the North Founders Street in the Commercial District. A cutscene will play out in which everything turns out well for Shingo and the quest will be completed. At this point, you’ll have to survey 10% of Mira, level up to Lv. 30, and only have Elma and Lin in your team in order to start the next story quest for Chapter 8! 

As a tip, a good way to level up to 30 at this point would be to get a Skell License, then you’ll get a free Skell, and at that point you can head to FN Site 120 in Primordia on the eastern coast to farm the Suids, (only during the day) Xiphias, and the one Cinicula that roams in that area. The Suids and Cinicula enemies both grant around 150 experience per kill, and the Cinicula grants around 480 experience. Just farm the area of Xiphias, then head upwards on the path killing the Suids, and finish off with the Cinicula. Then, once you’re done with that, head back down towards the data probe and kill the Suids that should have respawned, along with the Xiphias near the water. This is a good tactic for easy farming up to level 30, although it might take a bit of time. However, if you wish to do side quests until you reach level 30, that’s fine too. Regardless, it’s highly recommended you get a Skell, as it makes the future fights much, much easier.
