  <h3 style="color:red">chapter 5: Ma-non Maneuvers</h3><img style="width: 900px" src="./images/manon ship.png" alt="manon ship">
<p style="color:red"> prerequisites: Before beginning Chapter 5 you will have to install your first data probe in Oblivia and complete the Renewed Will Affinity Mission.

A cutscene will play out after you accept the mission in which Irina and Gwin come over for dinner. They’ll ask us to do a mission in Oblivia that Commander Vandham asked them to do in regards to investigating a possible Ganglian ship that was under attack, and Elma will accept it for us.  

If you haven’t yet done it, go add someone to your party so that we can have four total members. Head on over to the data probe we installed earlier in Oblivia via fast travel and head towards the yellow circle on the minimap. You’ll trigger a cutscene in which you discuss the languages of the different aliens.

After that, continue on the cliff to install the FN Site 302 data probe up ahead, and then go trigger the next cutscene at the objective marked by the yellow arrow by talking to the Xenoforms. During the cutscene, we’ll find out that the Ganglian are after the Mo-non and their technology and agree to deal with the anti-air turrets surrounding the area.

Once the cutscene is over, head over to the first turret location by following the path. Be a little careful, as there are enemies that can attack you and are hiding in the ground and other areas. Once you reach around the area with the first turret, you’ll find very high leveled enemies in the vicinity. You can take a detour around them and find the turret near some Lv. 21 and Lv. 22 Marnuck and Prone enemies. The turret itself is Lv. 16 and can actually be dealt with without needing to kill any of the other enemies as long as you position yourself correctly.  However, even if you’re underleveled, the Marnuck enemies can be dealt with as long as you take them out one by one. Once the turret is taken out, rather than going directly towards the second one, head towards the data probe location that can be found to the right of it, FN Site 306.

From there, head to the bridge area that crosses over to where the second turret is. On the other side, you’ll find two Lv. 18 Dagger Puges as well as one Lv. 21 Dagger Puge. Once they’re dead, you’ll find a tower with some Lv. 21 Prone enemies near the outside. Kill them, and then on the inside, you’ll find a Lv. 21 Marnuck enemy that you need to defeat as well. On the way up to the top floor of the building, one of the floors has an exit which leads to a Lv. 1 Archaeological field action. Interact with it and then head all the way up to the top. Ignore the Lv. 21 Marnuck and just focus on the Lv. 22 Marnuck Vanguard near the bridge. Once he’s dead, cross over and ignore the Lv. 19 Prone Warrior. You’ll want to do this because if you do, several other Lv. 20 enemies will attack you and we don’t want that. Head past him and go up the ledge area that is in front of him. Kill the Lv. 18 Prone Warrior at the top of the area, and then the Lv. 16 Dagger Puge to the right of him. Turn the corner of the building and kill the Lv. 15 Dagger Puge there.

Once it’s dead, prepare to fight three enemies: two Lv. 20 enemies, a Dagger Puge and Prone Condemned, as well as a Lv. 16 turret. This can be difficult if you aren’t prepared, but the best order to do this fight is to kill the Prone, then the Puge, and then the Turret.  Once it’s dead, head forward in the direction of the turret and kill the Lv. 19 Prone Warrior. Once it’s dead, kill the Lv. 21 Marnuck Vanguard. Continue down the path, killing the Lv. 19 Prone Warrior, Lv. 18 Prone Vix Guard, and the two Lv. 22 Marnuck Vanguards. Once they’re dead, maneuver around the Lv. 28 Sword Pugilith by using the large metal brackets that are behind it. Then, kill the Lv. 17 Dagger Puge to the left, the Lv. 19 Prone Warrior to the right, and the Lv. 18 Prone Condemned in front of the Prone Warrior.

Once you’ve done that, cross the bridge, and if you have Lv. 2 Archaeological, you can get the treasure from the field action. Kill the Lv. 15 Dagger Puge, and then kill the Lv. 18 Dagger Puge. Once they’re dead, wait for the Lv. 22 Sword Pugilith to walk in the direction towards the turret, and follow it. Once it stops, you can either maneuver around it if you don’t want some treasure later or kill it here, although it’s possible you can die here (although you would only have to kill a few Dagger Puges to get back to this position).

Then, go and attack the turret, but be mindful of the Lv. 17 Prone Barbarian. Once the last turret is dead, kill the Prone Barbarian and then the two Lv. 19 Dagger Puges.  If you didn’t kill the Sword Pugilith, I wouldn’t recommend doing this, as the two Lv. 19 Puges and the Lv. 22 Pugilith will most likely kill you, and it’s very likely that the Pugilith will join the battle. Once they’re dead, get the treasure from the Lv. 2 Mechanical field action.

Fast travel to FN Site 302, and then head to where the Ma-non were, and you’ll find that they are missing. Head towards the location marked on your minimap. You might have to fight a couple of enemies similar to your level, but once you get onto the cliff before the area, you’ll find multiple Prone enemies before it, but you can either deal with them or ignore them and head straight up to the objective.

Once you get near the middle of the yellow circle, you’ll find the Ganglion mechs terrorizing the Ma-non. Once the cutscene is over, we’ll be fighting two Lv. 18 Platoon Qmoeva and the Lv. 22 Chief Qmoeva. Just with all the other fights, try and focus on the Lv. 18 enemies first before fighting the Chief Qmoeva.

After you kill them, a cutscene will occur in which you find that you’re a mimeosome, or a robot. You’ll find that everyone is a mimeosome, and that everyone’s real bodies are still in the Lifehold, which is why it’s so important. Another thing we’ll find out is that the countdown on the BLADE Tower actually signifies how long until the Lifehold loses power, and if that happens, all the mimeosomes will shut down which would mean the end of the human race. Once you’re back in the game, head on over to the BLADE Tower to initiate a cutscene regarding Samaar, an intergalactic federation that spans over 6 million light years and the relocation of the Ma-non. After that, you’ll get several notifications regarding BLADE barracks customization, a new arms manufacturer, and a new method of attacking called Overdrive.
