<p style="color:red">Head back to BLADE Barracks, just around the corner of the tower. Once in the barracks, you will finally be given the option to join BLADE. After so much discussion of the organization’s importance and being introduced to its operations, it is a wonder why you aren’t given the option to recruit earlier. Nagi won’t really give you a choice. If you select to Refuse to join BLADE, he will guilt trip you into eventually accepting.

Primordia

Now that you have “voluntarily” chosen to join BLADE, it is time to complete your first mission: install the data probe at the FrontierNav site. Nagi will explain how the map system works, and you will be on your way.

After exiting the barracks, an onscreen message from Eleonora will brief you on the segment map. The map can be viewed from the GamePad screen. Tap the map icon (the top left square) to bring you to a world map of Mira. If you tap on the “NLA” tab, you will notice that there is a blue pin marking “Primordia” from the list of locations on the right. Selecting it will give you a segmented view of Primordia along with a closer look at the destination for your mission objective. With this in mind, follow the arrow on your mini-map to get through the East Gate.

Before heading directly to your objective, why not take a look around this section of Primordia. You will find a few enemy types while exploring: Wood Lepyx, Nocturnal Vesper, and Ovis. If you are feeling extra confident, go for the Wood Lepyx. To take them down, make sure to aim for their legs and stay far back. They have mid-range and close-range attacks, so it’s best to use your ranged weapon (Advanced Storm Assault Rifle) for the majority of the fight. Only switch to using melee arts when Elma tells you to move in.
Be careful with the creatures you pick a fight with. The Nocturnal Vespers attack on sight and the Wood Lepyxes only attack when provoked, but it might be best to ignore them for now. Ovises are a safe bet for farming for experience, given your current level.
After arriving at your destination and making a few decisions, you will have the exciting chance to battle your first tyrant. Before jumping in to fight, heed Lin’s advice and check that you have appropriate Ground Gear equipped and levelled-up arts. When it comes to Ground Gear, there won’t be much micromanaging to do just yet, but be sure to equip your highest level gear so that you are well-armed an appropriately protected for battle. The other party members won’t necessarily require you to make adjustments to their Ground Gear just yet. As for the arts, your character and the other party members have likely accumulated quite a few Battle Points by now, so make sure to allocate them appropriately to upgrade the arts.

The Cinicula won’t be all that difficult to take down, if you make sure to keep some distance between yourself and the enemy. Take aim at its legs with your assault rifle and your assault rifle arts. Soon enough, the Cinicula will fall and you will be on your way back to Nagi after reading a few tutorial screens. Note that the map screen is now marked with an icon indicating that you have successfully installed a data probe in that location.

Head back the way you came, but beware of Nocturnal Vespers as you do. They will attack on site, so stay alert and use Knife arts to defeat the flying enemies. Battling the Vespers is a useful way to begin levelling up your party.
After you’ve had enough, head over to BLADE Barracks to meet a new ally and complete Chapter 2.<p>
