<p style="color:red">The cutscene will first confirm that there is indeed a spy within NLA. Then, we’ll be assigned a mission in which we will have to repair a data probe in Sylvalum. After that, we’ll view another cutscene in which we see Ryyz and Dagahn planning to return to NLA now that they have a huge Skell, Zu Pharg. Once the cutscene is over, fast travel to the closest area in Sylvalum to the broken probe, FN Site 416. As always, if you don’t have that fast travel unlocked, head to the closest area and go to the objective from there.

Once you’re at FN Site 416, you’ll want to scale the huge cliff to the very right of you. If you have a Skell, you can just fly up and reach the broken data probe. However, if you need to walk up, there is a pathway upwards if you head south from the FN Site 416 while following the edge of the cliff. You can use that to get to the broken repair probe. Once you’re near the probe, Lin will begin fixing it up. She’ll finish up, give a speech, and then we’ll get a cutscene in which we’re introduced to Ryyz and Dagahn flying towards our direction in Zu Pharg, which we will have to fight.

Zu Pharg itself is a Lv. 39 enemy. It’ll immediately spawn two Lv. 35 Fal-swos. Defeat them, and then start attacking the Zu Pharg by targeting the large round discs. Then, two Lv. 35 Qmoevas will spawn from it. Kill them and continue to attack Zu Pharg. Once it reaches around half the health it has, a cutscene will occur in which Zu Pharg will transform into a giant Skell. It will regain all HP, and any broken appendages from before, and slowly start moving after taking some amount of damage. Again, it is recommended you attack the discs, and it will continually spawn enemies in the following order: two Lv. 35 Fal-swos, two Lv. 35 Qmoevas, one Lv. 36 Galdr, and two Lv. 36 Galdrs. Always focus on the reinforcements before attacking Zu Pharg Once you’ve destroyed all the disk appendages, there is a laser beam appendage in front of the Zu Pharg that you should try to defeat.

If you are in a Skell, it is highly recommended that during the fight you sometimes stop attacking to refresh the position of your party members, as they can still do good damage and will otherwise stay in their original positions making the fight practically a one on one engagement. This could be a tough fight if you aren’t prepared, so as with the other difficult fights don’t be afraid to lower the boss level if the game prompts you to. Once the Zu Pharg is destroyed, a cutscene will play out, and the mission for Chapter 10 will be over.

                In order to start the Chapter 11 story mission, we’ll need to do various things. First, we’ll have to do the “Nine Lives” and “Boot Camp” missions, then have 10% of Cauldros explored, have at least Elma and Lin in our party, and not have Nagi in our party. So, to start off, let’s do “Nine Lives” mission first. In order to do this mission, you’ll need Elma, Lin, and Gwin.  You already have Elma and Lin, and you can get Gwin in the Administrative District, across from the Restricted Hanger Elevator.

This mission is extremely easy for our level and can be found in the Commercial District in the Barista Court, to the left of where you face when you fast travel. Accept the quest, and we’ll be helping a friend of Gwin’s called Mathias to find his lost cat called Aisha. Once the cutscene is over, fast travel to the Restricted Hanger Entrance in the Administrative District and head over to where Doug is, going near anyone with yellow icons above their head. Once you’ve listened to the right person, you’ll be prompted with an update to the mission in which we need to meet with Mathias in the Industrial District, so fast travel over to the Integrated Production Plant or wherever is closest and go speak with him. Mathias will hear about the sighted cat in Cliffside Beach and head over there without discussing anything else, so now we’ll have to meet up with him there. Once you get near the objective, we’ll have to defeat a Lv. 20 Shallow Grex, which should be easy for you. A cutscene will then play out in which Aisha will be found but runs off.

We’ll need to then collect three Kiran Catnip from the blue crystals found around the area of FN Site 103, on the west edge of Primordia. Then, head back to where we met Mathias in the Cliffside Beach and speak to him again. Another cutscene will play out, and we’ll have to defeat a Lv. 21 Greed Forfex. the mission.

                Onto the next mission, “Boot Camp”, which will require you to have only Elma and Lin in your party, have one heart of affinity with Gwin, as well as for you to be Lv. 41. If you need one heart of affinity with Gwin, you can easily do so by doing quests with him as well as using arts that correspond to his soul voices while in battle.

Also, if you need to level up for the mission, and have you have a Skell, you can easily level up by grabbing two Claymore spare weapons and heading to Weeping Whitewood in Noctilum (located to the north-east of FN Site 215) to grind the Lv. 50~ Scirpos there. Be sure to hit them from above, however, as it is difficult for them to dodge that way. Each of these enemies grant around 500 experience each kill, meaning you will quickly and easily level up.

Once you’re Lv. 41 (or higher), head over to the Outfitters Test Hanger in the Industrial District and accept the quest. Gwin will want us to help him get stronger, and our first job will be to practice fighting him. He is Lv. 40 and shouldn’t be that difficult to defeat. After a cutscene, we’ll need to buy him a Soldier Assault Rifle and then speak to him in the Outfitters Test Hanger. He’ll join our party and we’ll need to then complete three objectives involving defeating some suids.

The battles themselves should not be difficult at all and can be done in any way, not just with the Soldier Assault Rifle, even with Skells. Once you’ve completed all three objectives, head back to the Outfitters Test Hanger and you’ll fight Gwin again, afterwards finishing up the mission. At this point, all you’ll need to do is explore 10% of Cauldros and have Elma, Lin, and some other party member who is not Nagi to start Chapter 11!
