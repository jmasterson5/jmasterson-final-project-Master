<p style="color: red"> While in BLADE Barracks you will discuss eight divisions that BLADE members can choose to be a part of. Each of the eight divisions focusses on a specific important task for the survival of citizens in NLA. Tasks include things like collecting materials, planting data probes, defending the land, attacking threats, and so on. Make your decision to become a full-fledged member of BLADE.

In a series of tutorial screens, Elenora will explain some things that have opened up for you due to your admittance into a division. You can now access things like the BLADE Mission Control. The ability to fast travel also unlocks, allowing you to travel quickly between landmarks and sites that have data probes installed. The segmented map can be used to access fast travel functions.

Lin will suggest that you visit Arms manufacturers (AMs) to learn more about working with them to make new gear in Armory Alley.

Your first objective in this chapter, presented to you by Commander Vandham, is to locate Nelson’s missing team in southeast Primordia. Begin by exiting the barracks.

Prior to executing your mission, let’s stop by the Arms Manufactures to see what it’s all about. The stall will be on your right side and is the first of many in Armory Alley. Many of the functions and upgradeables on offer require materials and miranium that you likely don’t possess thus far. It’s helpful to see what is available, so that when you have the requirements, you can return here to make your investments.
In this mission you'll encounter enemies mostly ranging from Level 7 to 10. Prepare thyself accordingly!
Continue travelling through the Administration District and back out into the wild—you can fast travel there. As you close the divide between your party and the destination, be wary of any Young Grexes. They will attack on site. At the checkpoint you will engage in a mandatory battle against two Prone Scouts. Use your assault rifle arts against the duo and they shouldn’t give you much trouble.

After a short discussion with your party members, look to the skies to find an orange beam. Travel towards this beam to install another data probe.

Once that is taken care of, begin making your way to the Seaswept base. Be caution around here, as several Prone Majors will be waiting to attack. Notice the large bridge overhead with the Prone Major guarding it, head around the hill the bridge is connected to in order to access it. You will need to reach higher ground and cross the bridge in order to reach your checkpoint. Destroy the Major and cross the bridge. Now, be sure to run toward the checkpoint to avoid being seen by the Prone Typhoon and his army of Domestic Armored Suids, unless you are up for some more experience. Be warned that you will have to fight two Pawn Puges just before arriving at your destination. These enemies are fast, so be sure to use your assault rifle and constantly move out of their way. When they are busy dealing your party members, move in quickly for some melee combat.

After that’s taken care of, head into the front entryway of the building on top of the cliffe. Looks like the missing team is dead, by the hands of these three brutes: Glennar and his two Prone Ruffians. Time to settle this with a mandatory dual.

Take aim at the two Prone Ruffians, as they will go down easily. Just focus your assault rifle fire on them to take them out. Now use all that you’ve got against Glennar. Melee attacks are useful when he is affected by stagger or topple, otherwise your assault rifle arts will do.

Following all the violence, you will be treated to a comedic, obnoxious new character: Tatsu. He offers you a Follow Ball and a little dance show. The handy Follow Ball will direct you to your destination. Just set a mission as your navigation target and then press R+X to send the orb flying along the path you need to travel. Go ahead and use it now to find your way back to Commander Vandham at the BLADE barracks.
Back at the barracks, it is decided that the Nopon, Tatsu, will join you in your quest to secure NLA on Mira and protect it from hostile xenos. With that, you have completed Chapter 3.
